1. The way I implemented fib and fibTail was very similar with the last line in match being the difference.
In Fib, the code takes the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence (excluding 0 and 1) and iterates 
based on n. In fibTail,the last call is stored in a variable and used for the next call. This makes the 
process of the fibonacci sequence far less demanding on the system.

2. Tail is far better for the fibonnacci sequence as instead of calculating every iteration of the sequence,
it stores each previous iteration and add the new one. Short answer: it's far more efficient and faster.
