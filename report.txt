1.
The main difference between myFoldl and myFold right is the order in which the operands are used.
In my myFoldl, myFoldl is called first with op, so that the acc can go throught the list from left to right.
In myFoldr, myFoldr is called after, so that the acc can go throught the list from right to left.

2.Which function you use depends upon the the problem. In myReverse, I used myFoldlr because it made more 
sense to iterate through the list backwards and return it rather than go through the extra hoops with myFoldr.
With map it doesn't matter as whichever way the list is mapped it will still take one iteration.
